# Indexes

Indexes are finite label sets used for collections of values. They enable typed, dimension-safe operations over multiple related values.

## Finite Label Indexes

Declare a finite index with named labels:

```
index Maneuver = { Departure, Correction, Insertion };
```

Labels conventionally use `PascalCase` and are namespaced by the index: `Maneuver.Departure`.

Named labels identify positions on an index axis. As an expression, a
qualified label is a self-typed constant [index key](#index-keys) of type
`Key<Maneuver>`. Like a constructor name, the same spelling also serves as a
syntactic selector in map/table keys, expected-fail keys, include index
bindings, and `match` patterns.

The label list is **ordered**: the sequence in which labels are declared is the
index order of the axis. Every index kind carries such an intrinsic order —
label declaration order here, coordinate order for
[coordinate indexes](#coordinate-indexes), and ascending positions for
[`Fin(N)`](#structural-finite-indexes). Order-sensitive operations, most
notably [`scan`](#scan-cumulative-fold), follow this order, and it also
determines rendering order and the element order of
[extern-function buffers](extern-functions.md).

!!! warning "Label order is semantic"
    `{ Departure, Correction, Insertion }` and
    `{ Insertion, Correction, Departure }` declare *different* indexes:
    `scan` accumulates in declared label order, so reordering the labels of an
    `index` declaration changes downstream results. Reorder labels only when
    the axis order itself should change.

!!! note "No empty indexes"
    Every index has at least one element. A named index must declare a label,
    `Fin(0)` is invalid, and coordinate constructors must produce at least one
    coordinate. Completed indexed values are therefore always nonempty. If an
    empty value reaches an aggregation internally, Graphcal reports `X001` as a
    compiler invariant violation; empty aggregation has no user-facing semantics.

!!! note "Contextual syntax names"
    `scan` and `unfold` select recurrence syntax only as bare call heads followed
    by `(`. `range`, `linspace`, `step`, and `points` are special only in
    coordinate-index declarations; `Fin` is special only in Index positions.
    Elsewhere these spellings remain ordinary identifiers.

## Indexed Values

Annotate a type with `[IndexName]` to create an indexed value:

```
node delta_v: Velocity[Maneuver] = {
    Maneuver.Departure: 2.46 km/s,
    Maneuver.Correction: 0.12 km/s,
    Maneuver.Insertion: 1.83 km/s,
};
```

Both `param` and `node` can be indexed.

Each axis may contain at most 1,000,000 entries, and the product of all concrete
axes in one eagerly materialized value must also be at most 1,000,000 scalar
leaves. The total limit is checked before evaluation—including after `Nat` and
required-index bindings are instantiated—so a compact multi-axis expression
cannot request an unbounded allocation. An oversized concrete shape is a
`D035` compile error.

An indexed value is a **total map**: every label of the index must appear
exactly once, and the compiler rejects missing or duplicate entries. The
written order of map entries is presentation only — the constructed value is
normalized to the index order, so listing `Maneuver.Insertion` first produces
exactly the same value. Only the `index` declaration determines the order; a
map or table literal cannot override it.

## Element Access

Access a specific element with `[Index.Label]`:

```
node departure_dv: Velocity = @delta_v[Maneuver.Departure];
```

Or with a loop variable, which is a key of the iterated axis:

```
node doubled: Velocity[Maneuver] = for m: Maneuver {
    @delta_v[m] * 2.0
};
```

For structural `Fin` indexes, constant-`Int` positions (`@v[2]`) are checked
statically, and a `Fin` loop variable supports additive
[Fin-key arithmetic](#fin-key-arithmetic):

```
param v: Dimensionless[Fin(4)] = for i: Fin(4) { 1.0 };
node shifted: Dimensionless[Fin(3)] = for i: Fin(3) { @v[i + 1] };
```

Any `Key`-typed expression selects an element the same way; see
[Key-Based Element Access](#key-based-element-access).

## `for` Comprehensions

Transform each element of an indexed value:

```
node doubled: Velocity[Maneuver] = for m: Maneuver {
    @delta_v[m] * 2.0
};
```

The result is a new indexed value with the same index.

For multi-axis comprehensions, the body may start with an explicit tuple-key
marker. The names are pure sugar and must exactly match the `for` bindings in
order; they do not introduce additional variables:

```
node v: Velocity[Maneuver, TimeStep] = for m: Maneuver, t: TimeStep {
    (m, t) => @accel[m] * coord(t)
};
```

## Aggregation Functions

Aggregation functions currently accept exactly one index axis. Numeric
aggregations require quantity elements. Most preserve the element dimension;
`product` raises it to the concrete axis cardinality. `count` accepts any
non-indexed element type and returns the exact cardinality as `Int`.
`argmax` and `argmin` return the *location* of the extremum as an
[index key](#index-keys) rather than its value.

| Function | Description | Result Type |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `sum(values)` | Sum of all elements | Same dimension as elements |
| `product(values)` | Product of all elements | Element dimension raised to axis cardinality |
| `maximum(values)` | Maximum element | Same dimension as elements |
| `minimum(values)` | Minimum element | Same dimension as elements |
| `argmax(values)` | Key of the maximum element | `Key<I>` |
| `argmin(values)` | Key of the minimum element | `Key<I>` |
| `mean(values)` | Arithmetic mean | Same dimension as elements |
| `rss(values)` | Root sum square | Same dimension as elements |
| `count(values)` | Number of elements | `Int` |

On ties, `argmax` and `argmin` return the first extremum in index order, so
the identity `@x[argmax(@x)] == maximum(@x)` is guaranteed (axes are never
empty).

```
node total: Velocity = sum(for m: Maneuver { @delta_v[m] });
node largest: Velocity = maximum(for m: Maneuver { @delta_v[m] });
node combined_sigma: Velocity = rss(for m: Maneuver { @delta_v[m] });
node n: Int = count(for m: Maneuver { @delta_v[m] });
node normalized: Velocity = sum(@delta_v) / to_float(count(@delta_v));
node critical: Key<Maneuver> = argmax(@delta_v);
node critical_dv: Velocity = @delta_v[@critical];
```

`Int` and quantity arithmetic never mix implicitly. Use `to_float(count(...))`
when a scalar calculation needs the cardinality. A multi-axis value must first be
projected to a single axis with an explicit `for` comprehension (`D021`); total-
and partial-axis aggregation are not yet defined.

## Index Keys

Every axis element is reflected at the term level as a **key** of type
`Key<I>`, where `I` is the axis — named, coordinate, `Fin`, or required.
This mirrors the `Dim`/`Quantity(D)` pattern: the axis stays a static,
type-level entity, while its elements become ordinary runtime values.

`Key<I>` is an ordinary value type. Keys can be stored in `node` and
`const node` declarations, passed to DAG params, carried in constructor
payload fields, and indexed themselves (`Key<TimeStep>[Maneuver]`). A key is
represented as its axis identity plus an element position — a coordinate key
carries the position, not the float coordinate, so re-indexing through a key
is exact and never a floating-point lookup.

```
index Maneuver = { Departure, Correction, Insertion };
param delta_v: Velocity[Maneuver] = {
    Maneuver.Departure: 2.46 km/s,
    Maneuver.Correction: 0.12 km/s,
    Maneuver.Insertion: 1.83 km/s,
};

node critical: Key<Maneuver> = argmax(@delta_v);
node critical_dv: Velocity = @delta_v[@critical];
```

### Labels Are Key Constants

A qualified label is a self-typed constant expression:
`Maneuver.Departure : Key<Maneuver>`. Exactly as a constructor name is both
an expression and a pattern, the label spelling keeps its selector role in
pattern-like positions — `match` arms, map/table keys, table headers and
slices — while everywhere else it is a `Key`-typed term:

```
node fallback: Key<Maneuver> = Maneuver.Correction;
```

Axis-less spellings are never keys implicitly: `node k: Key<Fin(3)> = 1;` is
rejected. Annotations check types, they do not convert integers into keys —
use the explicit formers below.

### Loop Variables Are Keys

A loop variable has exactly one type: the key type of its axis.

| Binding | Loop variable type | Content extraction |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `for m: Maneuver` | `Key<Maneuver>` | opaque (equality and `match` only) |
| `for t: TimeStep` | `Key<TimeStep>` | coordinate via `coord(t)` |
| `for i: Fin(3)` | `Key<Fin(3)>` | integer via `to_int(i)` |

There is no dual use: coordinate arithmetic and comparison go through the
explicit extraction `coord(t)`, and integer use of a `Fin` key through
`to_int(i)`. In particular `t == 0.5 s` is a type error — write
`coord(t) == 0.5 s`. The `unfold` closure binders over coordinates
(`prev_t`, `t`) follow the same rule.

### Equality and `match`

Keys of the same axis compare with `==` and `!=`. Keys of different axes
never compare, and keys have no ordering — extract the content first
(`coord(t1) < coord(t2)`, `to_int(i) < to_int(j)`) when an order is needed.

```
node critical: Key<Maneuver> = argmax(@delta_v);
node is_critical: Bool[Maneuver] = for m: Maneuver { m == @critical };
```

A key of a concrete named axis drives exhaustive `match`, with the same
label patterns used for named-index loop variables:

```
node contingency: Dimensionless = match @critical {
    Maneuver.Departure  => 1.10,
    Maneuver.Correction => 1.50,
    Maneuver.Insertion  => 1.25,
};
```

Keys of a required (`pub(bind)`) axis support indexing and equality only;
`match` needs the concrete label set.

### Key-Based Element Access

Brackets accept any `Key`-typed term per axis position, mixing labels, loop
variables, and computed keys freely:

```
node peak_per_maneuver: Key<TimeStep>[Maneuver] = for m: Maneuver {
    argmax(for t: TimeStep { @v[m, t] })
};
node v_at_peak: Velocity[Maneuver] = for m: Maneuver {
    @v[m, @peak_per_maneuver[m]]
};
```

Access is governed by axis identity: `Key<Maneuver>` cannot index a `Phase`
axis. The one widening is structural: `Key<Fin(N)>` is accepted where
`Key<Fin(M)>` is expected when `N <= M`. Structural `Fin` axes carry that
cardinality form directly; a declared axis must retain its checked semantic
definition rather than silently falling back to identity-only comparison.

!!! note "Evaluation granularity"
    Access with a compile-time-constant key (a label, a loop variable, or
    `key(...)`) keeps fine-grained per-element DAG edges. Access with a
    runtime key is a gather: the edge covers the whole indexed declaration.

### Extractions: `coord` and `to_int`

The only key extractions are:

| Function | Signature | Applies to |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| `coord(k)` | `Key<C> -> Quantity(D)` | coordinate axes over dimension `D` |
| `to_int(k)` | `Key<Fin(N)> -> Int` | `Fin` axes only |

For a `Fin` key the position is the semantic content; for a coordinate key
only the coordinate is exposed, because exposing its position would couple
programs to the grid definition. A named key is opaque: it supports equality
and `match`, nothing else.

```
node peak: Key<TimeStep> = argmax(@altitude);
node peak_time: Time = coord(@peak);
```

### Introducing Keys

All introduction forms state their axis explicitly:

| Form | Checking | Fallible? |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Label expression `Maneuver.Departure` | compile time | no |
| Loop variable | compile time | no |
| `argmax(v)` / `argmin(v)` | — | no (axes are non-empty) |
| `key(Fin(N), c)` with static `c` | compile-time range check | no |
| `fin_key(Fin(N), e)` with runtime `Int` `e` | runtime range check | yes |
| `floor_key(C, q)` / `ceil_key(C, q)` | runtime | yes (outside the axis range) |
| `nearest_key(C, q)` | runtime | no (total) |

`key(Fin(N), c)` takes a static constant and is fully discharged during
checking; an out-of-range position is a compile error. `fin_key(Fin(N), e)`
accepts a runtime `Int` and range-checks it during evaluation — a failure is
a per-node evaluation error, and downstream nodes receive
`DependencyFailed`. Named axes need no positional former (write the label),
and coordinate axes have no exact quantity-to-key cast: select a grid point
with an explicit search policy instead.

```
param readings: Pressure[Fin(8)] = for i: Fin(8) { 100.0 Pa };
node second: Key<Fin(8)> = key(Fin(8), 1);
param requested: Int = 5;
node channel: Key<Fin(8)> = fin_key(Fin(8), @requested);
node selected: Pressure = @readings[@channel];
```

The coordinate searches take a quantity of the axis dimension and return the
grid point below (`floor_key`), above (`ceil_key`), or closest to
(`nearest_key`) the query. `floor_key` and `ceil_key` fail when the query
falls outside the axis range; `nearest_key` is total, and a midpoint tie
resolves toward the axis start.

```
index TimeStep = range(0.0 s, 10.0 s, step: 0.1 s);
param event_time: Time = 3.47 s;
node before_event: Key<TimeStep> = floor_key(TimeStep, @event_time);
node near_event: Key<TimeStep> = nearest_key(TimeStep, @event_time);
```

!!! warning "No implicit runtime indexing"
    A runtime `Int` never indexes a `Fin` axis implicitly (`@x[@n]` is
    rejected — write `fin_key(Fin(N), @n)`), and a quantity never looks up a
    coordinate axis (`@x[@t]` is rejected — pick a policy with
    `nearest_key` / `floor_key` / `ceil_key`). Statically discharged
    constant positions such as `@x[2]` remain legal.

### Fin-Key Arithmetic

A `Fin` key plus a static Nat constant is again a `Fin` key, with the bound
tracked exactly in the type:

```text
i : Key<Fin(N)>,  c a static Nat  ⟹  i + c : Key<Fin(N + c)>
```

The shift is exact and infallible — the bound grows in the type, so there is
no runtime check, wraparound, or clamp. It composes directly with indexing
and `Fin` widening:

```
param values: Velocity[Fin(5)] = for i: Fin(5) { 1.0 m/s };
node diffs: Velocity[Fin(4)] = for i: Fin(4) {
    @values[i + 1] - @values[i]   // i + 1 : Key<Fin(5)> — exact
};
node smoothed: Velocity[Fin(3)] = for i: Fin(3) {
    (@values[i] + @values[i + 1] + @values[i + 2]) / 3.0
};
```

The fragment is deliberately exact: one key, `+`, static Nat constants.
Everything else is excluded for a stated reason:

- `i - 1` — fallible at position 0, and Nat has no subtraction; restructure
  additively (take `T[Fin(N + 1)]` input and produce `T[Fin(N)]` output).
- `i * 2`, `i + j` — only loose static bounds exist, which could not widen
  into the natural target axis.
- `i % c`, `i / c` — wraparound and truncation are data policies, not index
  arithmetic.
- `i + @k` with runtime `@k` — a runtime offset escapes any static bound;
  write `to_int(i) + @k : Int` and re-enter through `fin_key`.

Named and coordinate keys have no arithmetic at all: for named keys it would
couple runtime behavior to label declaration order, and for coordinate keys
it is ambiguous (position or coordinate?) — use `coord(t)` and quantity
arithmetic instead.

!!! note "Rendering and boundaries"
    Keys render at output boundaries as their label, position, or coordinate
    (presentation only). Coordinate keys use their axis's display scale and
    unit—for example, a key on an axis declared in seconds renders as `2 s`,
    not as position `2`. JSON and boundary inputs likewise encode coordinate
    keys by coordinate rather than position. Boundary inputs encode named keys
    by label and `Fin` keys by position. Keys do not cross the experimental
    plugin ABI (same posture as `Complex`).

## `scan` (Cumulative Fold)

`scan` computes a running accumulation across the index order:

```
node cumulative: Velocity[Maneuver] = scan(@delta_v, 0.0 m/s, |acc, item| acc + item);
```

Arguments:

1. The indexed value to scan over
2. The initial accumulator value
3. A closure `|acc, item| expr` that combines the accumulator with each item

The result is an indexed value where each element is the accumulated result up to and including that element.

The source must have exactly one axis. `scan` never chooses an axis implicitly
from a multi-axis source; use an explicit `for` comprehension to select each
rank-one series first. The accumulator may itself be indexed. Its axes are
preserved after the source axis in the result:

```
index Element = { A, B };
node increments: Dimensionless[Maneuver] = for maneuver: Maneuver { 1.0 };
node initial: Dimensionless[Element] = for element: Element { 0.0 };
node state: Dimensionless[Maneuver, Element] = scan(
    @increments,
    @initial,
    |previous, increment| for element: Element {
        previous[element] + increment
    }
);
```

The body must return exactly the accumulator type, including every state axis
and its order. Each iteration reads the complete previous accumulator before
constructing the next one.

The accumulation order is the index order, which is intrinsic to the index —
never to how a particular value was written:

- **Named index**: label declaration order (`Departure`, then `Correction`,
  then `Insertion` for the `Maneuver` axis above).
- **Coordinate index**: coordinate order, from `start` toward `end`
  (descending when the step is negative).
- **`Fin(N)`**: ascending positions `#0` through `#(N-1)`.

Because indexed values are normalized to index order, scanning a map literal
that lists `Maneuver.Insertion` first still accumulates `Departure` first.

## Multi-Indexed Values

Values can be indexed by multiple label indexes using tuple keys:

```
index Phase = { Launch, Cruise, Arrival };

node spacecraft_mass: Mass[Phase, Maneuver] = {
    (Phase.Launch, Maneuver.Departure): 5000.0 kg,
    (Phase.Launch, Maneuver.Correction): 0.0 kg,
    (Phase.Launch, Maneuver.Insertion): 0.0 kg,
    (Phase.Cruise, Maneuver.Departure): 0.0 kg,
    (Phase.Cruise, Maneuver.Correction): 4500.0 kg,
    (Phase.Cruise, Maneuver.Insertion): 0.0 kg,
    (Phase.Arrival, Maneuver.Departure): 0.0 kg,
    (Phase.Arrival, Maneuver.Correction): 0.0 kg,
    (Phase.Arrival, Maneuver.Insertion): 4000.0 kg,
};
```

Access elements with multiple index arguments:

```
node launch_dep: Mass = @spacecraft_mass[Phase.Launch, Maneuver.Departure];
```

## Mixed Label and Coordinate Indexes

Values can combine categorical label axes with coordinate axes such as time.

### Construction via `for` Comprehension

The most common way to create a mixed-index value is with a multi-binding `for` comprehension:

```
index Maneuver = { Departure, Correction, Insertion };
index TimeStep = range(0.0 s, 1.0 s, step: 0.5 s);

node accel: Acceleration[Maneuver] = {
    Maneuver.Departure: 10.0 m/s^2,
    Maneuver.Correction: 5.0 m/s^2,
    Maneuver.Insertion: -3.0 m/s^2,
};

node v: Velocity[Maneuver, TimeStep] = for m: Maneuver, t: TimeStep {
    @accel[m] * coord(t)
};
```

The coordinate loop variable `t` is a key of the `TimeStep` axis; the
quantity coordinate it stands on is extracted explicitly with `coord(t)`
(see [Index Keys](#index-keys)).

### Construction via Quantity-Keyed Literals

A concrete coordinate axis can also be populated directly with coordinate
quantities. In a plain map, the axis of each quantity key is inferred from the
declaration's indexed type:

```
index Altitude = range(300.0 km, 320.0 km, step: 10.0 km);

node density: (Mass/Length^3)[Altitude] = {
    300.0 km: 1.20 kg/m^3,
    310.0 km: 1.15 kg/m^3,
    320.0 km: 1.10 kg/m^3,
};
```

Quantity keys must be statically evaluable, have the coordinate index's
dimension, and lie on an actual generated grid point. Dynamic units and runtime
references are rejected. As with named-index maps, every grid point must appear
exactly once; entry order is not significant.

Tuple map keys may mix coordinate quantities and named labels. A `table`
declares its axes explicitly, so coordinate quantities can be used as row,
column, or slice labels:

```
node envelope: Pressure[Maneuver, Altitude] = table[Maneuver, Altitude] {
    : 300.0 km, 310.0 km, 320.0 km;
    Departure: 101.0 kPa, 95.0 kPa, 90.0 kPa;
    Correction: 100.0 kPa, 94.0 kPa, 89.0 kPa;
    Insertion: 99.0 kPa, 93.0 kPa, 88.0 kPa;
};
```

### Construction via Map Literal with `for` Values

You can also use a map literal where each named-label entry contains a
comprehension over a coordinate index:

```
node v: Velocity[Maneuver, TimeStep] = {
    Maneuver.Departure: for t: TimeStep { @accel[Maneuver.Departure] * coord(t) },
    Maneuver.Correction: for t: TimeStep { @accel[Maneuver.Correction] * coord(t) },
    Maneuver.Insertion: for t: TimeStep { @accel[Maneuver.Insertion] * coord(t) },
};
```

### Mixed-Axis Element Access

Access elements by providing both a label and a range variable:

```
node departure_v: Velocity[TimeStep] = for t: TimeStep {
    @v[Maneuver.Departure, t]
};
```

### Aggregation

Aggregate over either axis independently:

```
// Sum over the label axis for each time step
node total_v: Velocity[TimeStep] = for t: TimeStep {
    sum(for m: Maneuver { @v[m, t] })
};

// Max over the time axis for each maneuver
node max_v: Velocity[Maneuver] = for m: Maneuver {
    maximum(for t: TimeStep { @v[m, t] })
};
```

## Table Literals

For multi-indexed values, the `table` expression provides a spreadsheet-like layout that is easier to read:

### 1D Table

```
param delta_v: Velocity[Maneuver] = table[Maneuver] {
    Departure:  2.46 km/s;
    Correction: 0.12 km/s;
    Insertion:  1.83 km/s;
};
```

Named axes in `table[...]` accept the same full paths as indexed types, including module-qualified paths such as `mission.Maneuver`. Labels in ordinary table bodies are bare (`Departure`, not `Maneuver.Departure`) because `table[...]` explicitly supplies exactly one owner for each row or column axis. Rows are terminated with `;`.

### 2D Table

```
param m: Mass[Phase, Maneuver] = table[Phase, Maneuver] {
    : Departure, Correction, Insertion;
    Launch:  5000.0 kg, 0.0 kg,    0.0 kg;
    Cruise:     0.0 kg, 4500.0 kg, 0.0 kg;
    Arrival:    0.0 kg, 0.0 kg,    4000.0 kg;
};
```

The last index becomes columns, the second-to-last becomes rows. The header row starts with `:` and lists the column labels, followed by data rows with `RowLabel: value, value, ...;`. Commas separate cells; the semicolon is the explicit row (second-dimension) delimiter, so do not add a redundant trailing comma before it.

### 3D+ Table

For three or more indexes, use slice sections with qualified labels:

```
param m: Mass[Time, Phase, Maneuver] = table[Time, Phase, Maneuver] {
    [Time.T1]
    : Departure, Correction, Insertion;
    Launch:  5000.0 kg, 0.0 kg,    0.0 kg;
    Cruise:     0.0 kg, 4500.0 kg, 0.0 kg;
    Arrival:    0.0 kg, 0.0 kg,    4000.0 kg;

    [Time.T2]
    : Departure, Correction, Insertion;
    Launch:  4800.0 kg, 0.0 kg,    0.0 kg;
    Cruise:     0.0 kg, 4300.0 kg, 0.0 kg;
    Arrival:    0.0 kg, 0.0 kg,    3800.0 kg;
};
```

Each `[SliceLabel]` section contains its own header row and data rows. Named
slice labels use `Index.Variant` syntax (or `module.Index.Variant` when the
index is imported); `Fin` slice labels use `#N`.

### Finite-Index Tables

Use explicit `Fin(N)` axes for positional vectors and matrices. Their labels are
`#0, #1, ...` and are omitted from ordinary rows and columns:

```
// 1D Fin axis
param v: Dimensionless[Fin(3)] = table[Fin(3)] {
    1.0;
    2.0;
    3.0;
};

// 2D, both axes finite
param m: Dimensionless[Fin(2), Fin(3)] = table[Fin(2), Fin(3)] {
    1.0, 2.0, 3.0;
    4.0, 5.0, 6.0;
};

// 2D, mixed: named columns, finite rows
param mixed: Dimensionless[Fin(2), Maneuver] = table[Fin(2), Maneuver] {
    : Departure, Correction;
    1.0, 2.0;
    3.0, 4.0;
};

// 3D with a finite slice axis
param m3d: Dimensionless[Fin(2), Phase, Maneuver] = table[Fin(2), Phase, Maneuver] {
    [#0]
    : Departure, Correction;
    Launch: 1.0, 2.0;
    Cruise: 3.0, 4.0;

    [#1]
    : Departure, Correction;
    Launch: 5.0, 6.0;
    Cruise: 7.0, 8.0;
};
```

Slice labels (all but the last two axes) always require an explicit marker:
`[Index.Variant]` for named axes or `[#N]` for `Fin` axes. The same conventions
apply to multi-declaration shared axes: a `Fin` row axis has unlabeled rows, and
a `Fin` slice axis uses `[#N]` sections.

The `table` expression is pure syntax sugar -- it desugars to a map literal at parse time.
For a coordinate axis, use coordinate quantities instead of named labels in
the corresponding rows, columns, or slice headers.

## Multi-declarations

A **multi-declaration** is a single surface form that introduces N parallel `param` / `node` / `const node` declarations sharing the same row axis. It aligns values that belong together on the same row:

```
pub index Component = { ComponentA, ComponentB };

param      power_consumption: Power[Component],
param      duty_cycle:        Dimensionless[Component],
const node mass_per_unit:     Mass[Component]
  = table[Component, (_, _, _)] {
      :           _,       _,    _;
      ComponentA: 10.0 W,  0.5,  2.5 kg;
      ComponentB: 12.0 W,  1.0,  3.1 kg;
  };
```

- Each slot on the left-hand side is a full declaration: kind (`param` / `node` / `const node`), name, and type annotation.
- The `table[SharedAxis, (…)]` bracket declares the row axis followed by a parenthesized slot tuple. The comma before the tuple is required. Each tuple entry is either `_` (1-D slot typed `T[SharedAxis]`) or a named axis, including module-qualified axes (2-D slot typed `T[SharedAxis, ExtraAxis]`).
- The header row `: …;` has exactly one cell per column. For 1-D slots the cell must be `_`. Every 2-D slot cell must use the qualified `ExtraAxis.Variant` form (including the full module path when imported), because one heterogeneous header can concatenate columns owned by different axes.
- Data-row labels remain bare because the shared row axis is explicit in the table prefix.

Mixed 1-D / 2-D slots:

```
pub index Component = { ComponentA, ComponentB };
pub index OperationMode = { Safe, Nominal };

param      power_consumption:  Power[Component],
param      n_installed:        Int[Component],
const node mass_per_unit:      Mass[Component],
param      power_mode_active:  Bool[Component, OperationMode]
  = table[Component, (_, _, _, OperationMode)] {
      :            _,       _, _,      OperationMode.Safe, OperationMode.Nominal;
      ComponentA:  10.0 W,  1, 2.5 kg,               true,                  true;
      ComponentB:  12.0 W,  2, 3.1 kg,              false,                  true;
  };
```

Currently, at most one slot may carry an extra axis; multiple adjacent extra-axis slots are planned for a later extension.

### N-D with slice sections

When the shared-axis prefix has more than one axis, the body uses slice sections. Each slice section begins with a `[Axis.Variant, …]` label covering every shared axis **except the last** (which becomes the row axis), followed by a header row and data rows as usual.

```
pub index Phase = { Launch, Cruise };
pub index Component = { ComponentA, ComponentB };
pub index OperationMode = { Safe, Nominal };

param      power_consumption: Power[Phase, Component],
param      power_mode_active: Bool[Phase, Component, OperationMode]
  = table[Phase, Component, (_, OperationMode)] {
      [Phase.Launch]
      :            _,       OperationMode.Safe, OperationMode.Nominal;
      ComponentA:  5.0 W,                 true,                 false;
      ComponentB:  6.0 W,                false,                 false;

      [Phase.Cruise]
      :            _,       OperationMode.Safe, OperationMode.Nominal;
      ComponentA:  10.0 W,                true,                  true;
      ComponentB:  12.0 W,               false,                  true;
  };
```

Slice labels must qualify each shared axis in the declared order (`Phase.Launch`, not bare `Launch`), matching the convention used for single-decl 3D+ tables.

### Editor integration

Each slot in a multi-declaration is its own declaration for the purposes of navigation: `gotoDefinition`, `findReferences`, `rename`, and `hover` all land on the slot header, and each slot receives its own inlay hint at its name. Axis and qualified header/slice references participate in navigation and rename as well. The formatter preserves the multi-decl surface form while canonicalizing alignment and retaining every required axis qualifier. Cell-level inlay hints (projecting slot names into the header row of the source) remain future work.

- Multi-declarations are **pure syntactic sugar**: each slot desugars to an ordinary declaration with its own `table[SharedAxis] { … }` initializer. Cross-slot references work exactly as for any other declarations (`@other_slot[Variant]`).
- Attributes (`#[…]`) are not allowed on a multi-declaration. Visibility is
  written per slot and follows the ordinary declaration rules (`pub node` is
  valid; `pub param` and `pub(bind) node` are not).

## Coordinate Indexes

Coordinate indexes carry statically known quantity coordinates. Bounds and
spacing must be finite, compile-time quantities with the same dimension.
Runtime inputs and integer (`Int`) values are not accepted.

### Exact-Step `range`

Use `range` when the increment is authoritative:

```
index TimeStep = range(0.0 s, 1.0 s, step: 0.25 s);
index Countdown = range(1.0 s, -1.0 s, step: -0.5 s);
```

The step must be nonzero and point from `start` toward `end`. It must land on
the endpoint exactly within floating-point validation tolerance; Graphcal does
**not** clip or overshoot. For example,
`range(0.0 s, 1.0 s, step: 0.6 s)` is rejected. Interior coordinates are derived
directly from `start + position * step`, avoiding cumulative drift, and the
validated final coordinate preserves the declared endpoint.

### Count-Based `linspace`

Use `linspace` when the number of points is authoritative:

```
index Samples = linspace(0.0 s, 1.0 s, points: 5);
```

This produces exactly five coordinates and preserves both declared endpoints.
`points` must be a static positive `Nat`. A singleton is valid only when the
endpoints are identical:

```
index Origin = linspace(0.0 m, 0.0 m, points: 1);
```

Both constructors support ascending and descending coordinates. Concrete index
cardinalities are limited to 1,000,000 elements to prevent accidental massive
allocations.

## Structural Finite Indexes

`Fin(N)` is an explicit structural index with integer positions `0` through
`N - 1`. It is distinct from the `Nat` value `N`: Graphcal never converts a
bare Nat into an Index implicitly.

```
// A 3-element vector
param v: Dimensionless[Fin(3)] = for i: Fin(3) { 1.0 };

// A 2-by-3 matrix
param m: Dimensionless[Fin(2), Fin(3)] =
    for i: Fin(2), j: Fin(3) { 1.0 };
```

Write `Fin(N)` in every Index position, including indexed types, `for`
bindings, tables, Index-sorted generic arguments, and bindings for required
discrete index ports. Obsolete forms such as `Dimensionless[3]`,
`for i: range(3)`, and `table[3]` are rejected with a `Fin(3)` suggestion.
`Fin(0)` and cardinalities above the practical limit are invalid.

### Generic Sorts Stay Distinct

A `Nat` argument remains a Nat, while `Fin(...)` is an Index argument:

```
type Vector<N: Nat, D: Dim> {
    Vector(values: D[Fin(N)]),
}

type IndexedVector<I: Index, D: Dim> {
    IndexedVector(values: D[I]),
}

param a: Vector<3, Dimensionless>;
param b: IndexedVector<Fin(3), Dimensionless>;
```

Consequently, `Vector<Fin(3), Dimensionless>` and
`IndexedVector<3, Dimensionless>` are sort errors rather than implicit
conversions.

### Nat Arithmetic and Iteration

The cardinality inside `Fin(...)` may use Nat addition and multiplication, such
as `Fin(N + 1)` or `Fin(Rows * Cols)`. Multiplication binds more tightly than
addition. Nat expressions are normalized to canonical polynomial form.
Subtraction is deliberately unsupported; express the larger side additively,
for example use `D[Fin(N + 1)]` for an input and `D[Fin(N)]` for a smaller
output.

A `Fin(N)` loop variable is a key of type `Key<Fin(N)>` (see
[Index Keys](#index-keys)). It can index the corresponding value, and its
integer position is extracted explicitly with `to_int(i)`:

```
node doubled: Dimensionless[Fin(3)] =
    for i: Fin(3) { @v[i] * 2.0 };
node positions: Dimensionless[Fin(3)] =
    for i: Fin(3) { to_float(to_int(i)) };
```

Additive [Fin-key arithmetic](#fin-key-arithmetic) tracks the bound in the
type, so shifted access is checked statically:

```
param values: Velocity[Fin(4)] = for i: Fin(4) { 1.0 m/s };
node diffs: Velocity[Fin(3)] =
    for i: Fin(3) { @values[i + 1] - @values[i] };
```

`Fin` axes compose with named indexes:

```
index Phase = { Launch, Cruise };
node data: Dimensionless[Fin(3), Phase] =
    for i: Fin(3), p: Phase { 1.0 };
```

## Required Indexes

An index can be declared **without** specifying its labels or coordinates. These
are **required indexes** — they must be bound via a
[parameterized include](multi-file.md#index-bindings) when the DAG is used as a
library.

### Required Discrete Index

```
pub(bind) index Axis;
```

This declares an unconstrained discrete index port `Axis`. A caller can bind it
to a concrete named index, forward another compatible required discrete index,
or supply a structural axis such as `Fin(3)` directly. Coordinate axes use the
dimension-constrained form below instead.

Required indexes form the library's bindable interface and must carry
`pub(bind)` (see [Visibility, Bindability, and Input Ports](multi-file.md#visibility-bindability-and-input-ports)).
Omitting the annotation — or writing plain `pub` — is error `V002`.

### Required Coordinate Index

```
pub(bind) index Step: Time;
```

This declares a coordinate index `Step` constrained to dimension `Time`. The
including DAG must bind it to a `range` or `linspace` index with the same
dimension. A generic outer DAG may instead forward its own compatible required
coordinate index; that outer input must eventually be bound to a concrete axis.

### Using Required Indexes

Required indexes are used exactly like concrete indexes — as axes in type annotations, `for` comprehensions, index access, `match`, and map/table literals:

```
pub(bind) index Phase;

param cost: Dimensionless[Phase];
pub node total: Dimensionless = sum(for p: Phase { @cost[p] });
```

The file cannot be evaluated standalone. It must be included with a binding
that supplies a compatible index (see [Index Bindings](multi-file.md#index-bindings)).

## `unfold` (Recurrence Relations)

`unfold` computes values over an explicit coordinate index where each value
depends on the previous state:

```
node x: Dimensionless[TimeStep] = unfold(
    TimeStep,
    @x0,
    |prev_x, prev_t, t| prev_x * (1.0 + @rate * (coord(t) - coord(prev_t)))
);
```

The first coordinate receives `@x0`. At every later coordinate, the body
receives the previous value together with the previous and current
coordinate keys (`Key<TimeStep>`); their quantity coordinates are extracted
with `coord(...)`, exactly as for coordinate loop variables. The axis
belongs to the expression; the enclosing declaration's type is not consulted
to select it, so `unfold` can be nested or consumed immediately:

```
node total: Dimensionless = sum(
    unfold(TimeStep, @x0, |prev_x, prev_t, t| prev_x + @rate * (coord(t) - coord(prev_t)))
);
```

Use the `prev_x` binding directly when computing the next step. A reference to
`@x` in its own initializer is an ordinary dependency cycle, including
`@x[prev_t]`, `@x[t]`, and future-coordinate forms. This is useful for
time-stepping simulations and discrete dynamic systems.

### Indexed recurrence state

The state may be indexed over one or more fixed axes. `unfold` prepends its
coordinate axis to those state axes:

```text
initial:    T[Element]
trajectory: T[TimeStep, Element]

initial:    T[Row, Column]
trajectory: T[TimeStep, Row, Column]
```

This supports coupled systems where every next component reads the complete
previous snapshot. For example, the matrix-vector recurrence
`x(next) = coupling * x(previous)` is:

```
pub index Element = { A, B };
pub index TimeStep = range(0.0 s, 2.0 s, step: 1.0 s);

param initial: Dimensionless[Element] = {
    Element.A: 1.0,
    Element.B: 2.0,
};
param coupling: Dimensionless[Element, Element] = {
    (Element.A, Element.A): 1.0,
    (Element.A, Element.B): 1.0,
    (Element.B, Element.A): 1.0,
    (Element.B, Element.B): 0.0,
};

node trajectory: Dimensionless[TimeStep, Element] = unfold(
    TimeStep,
    @initial,
    |previous, previous_time, time| for i: Element {
        sum(for j: Element { @coupling[i, j] * previous[j] })
    }
);
```

All components for one coordinate are constructed from the same frozen
`previous` value, so loop order cannot turn a simultaneous update into an
in-place update. The body must return exactly the initial state's element type,
axes, and axis order. This is ordinary multi-axis syntax, not a nested type such
as `T[Element][TimeStep]`.

See the complete runnable
[`indexed_state_recurrence.gcl`](https://github.com/graphcal-lang/graphcal/blob/main/tests/fixtures/valid/indexed_state_recurrence.gcl)
fixture for indexed `unfold` and `scan` examples.

## Aggregation Over Any Index

Use aggregation functions directly on indexed values:

```
node total_dv: Velocity = sum(for m: Maneuver { @delta_v[m] });
```

Built-in aggregation functions (`sum`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `argmin`,
`argmax`, `mean`, `count`) work with any index type.
