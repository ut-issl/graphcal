//! Per-DAG HIR construction from a desugared syntax tree.
//!
//! `lower()` combines declaration collection (`resolve`), registry
//! construction (dimensions, units, indexes, structs), and function
//! registration into one [`HirDag`]. Reference resolution happens at
//! [`UnfrozenIR::freeze`], which lowers every assembled declaration body to
//! HIR — a frozen DAG carries no syntax-AST expression.
